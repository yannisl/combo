## The combo LaTeX package

The `combo` package, provides a small utility to
overlay text over an image for LaTeX documents.  The
package provides a user interface using a key value, interface
that closely follows css styling. If you familiar with
web development, you might find this approach easier to remember.

The package is released under the LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c or later
See http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt

This work consists of the file  `combo.dtx`,
and the derived files   `combo.ins`,  `combo.pdf`, and `combo.sty`.

###Installation

run
   pdflatex combo.dtx
   makeindex -s gind.ist combo.idx
